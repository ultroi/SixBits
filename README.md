### Vercel Deployment

#### Prerequisites
- Vercel account
- MongoDB Atlas or cloud database
- Google AI API key

#### Deployment Steps

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. **Login to Vercel**
```bash
vercel login
```

3. **Deploy to Vercel**
```bash
# From the root directory
vercel

# For production deployment
npm run vercel-deploy
```

4. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

### Environment Configuration

#### For Local Development
Create `.env` files in both `backend/` and `frontend/` directories:

**backend/.env:**
```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/Zariya
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

dev-switch.bat vercel  # For Vercel deployment
```
